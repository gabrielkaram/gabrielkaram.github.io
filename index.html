<h1>Gabriel Karam</h1>
<P>Student at University of Maine</P>
<IMG SRC="graduated.jpg">
<p>Hello world. <I>Welcome to my homepage.</I> I am a student 
at the <A HREF=https://umaine.edu/> University of Maine</A>, majoring in 
the <A HREF=https://umaine.edu/business/> Maine Business School </A>. 
I live in Bangor, and am the youngest of three brothers. In the summer, I work 
at <A HREF=http://getchellbros.com/> Getchell Brothers</A>. I personally enjoy the great 
outdoors, and think that Maine is one of the greatest places on Earth to explore and have 
adventures, such as its beautiful Acadia National Park, its many lakes and long ocean 
coastline, and its wooded forests. I enjoy swimming, biking, hiking, kayaking, chilling
with family, and various other activities. I am a terrible cook, but food itself is pretty
awesome (I could probably live off pizza, with my favorite pizza probably being 
<A HREF=http://www.tricitypizzabangor.com//> Tri City Pizza</A>). I also take interest in 
politics and a variety of other academic pursuits. </p>
<p>In this website you'll be able to look at my Bangor page, my page about UMaine, my page 
about Getchell Brothers, and my resume.</p>
