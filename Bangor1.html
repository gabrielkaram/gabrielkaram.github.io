<h1>Bangor, Maine</h1>
<IMG SRC="Bangor.jpg">
<p>Hello, and welcome to <A HREF=http://www.bangormaine.gov//> Bangor</A>, Maine. I have
lived in this city of about 30,000 for my entire life. I was born here, raised here, and 
graduated from <A HREF=http://bangorhigh.bangorschools.net//> Bangor High School</A>. 
Bangor High has received several recognitions, and is considered to be one of the
academically, athletically, and artistically, best high schools in the state. (Colleges like Bangor kids)!
Although it was once a logging town by the Penobscot River, Bangor is now becoming more 
of a small metropolis and center of commerce. Among other things, Bangor is known for 
attracting many workers from nearby areas during the work day, its new businesses 
(like <A HREF=https://www.chick-fil-a.com/> Chik Fil a</A>), its exciting downtown area, and the
 <A HREF=http://www.bangormaine.gov/police/> Bangor Police Department</A>, which is well 
 known for its <A HREF=https://www.facebook.com/bangormainepolice/> Facebook page</A> 
 (sometimes even making <A HREF=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/12/16/this-may-be-the-only-police-department-in-america-with-a-funny-facebook-page//> 
 national news</A>!) Although many Bangor High graduates move elsewhere or go to UMaine,
 Bangor is home to <A HREF=http://www.husson.edu//> Husson University</A> and
 <A HREF=http://www.emcc.edu//> Eastern Maine Community College</A>. Bangor is a great 
 place to live, attend school, work, and visit.
