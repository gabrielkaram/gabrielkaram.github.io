	<p>Hello. I am a student at the 
	<A HREF=https://umaine.edu/> University of Maine</A>, 
	in the class 2020. I am majoring in
 	<A HREF=https://umaine.edu/business/> business</A> (currently undeclared in the business
 	curriculum). This year, the University has faced a titanic increase in its incoming class,
 	resulting in a drastically increased number of students. UMaine is well known
 	for its high achieving <A HREF=https://engineering.umaine.edu//> engineering department</A>,
 	popularized by clever innovations such as the "Bridge in a Basket" and synthesizing realistic
 	ocean conditions for a "<A HREF=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-18dBsuGx0/> testing pool</A>,"
 	 but it also has a reputable business, computer science,
 	and a variety of other departments. The <A HREF=https://umaine.edu/campusrecreation/facilities/wallace-pool//>
 	 athletic and recreation</A> facilities are looked favorably by students in New England
 	 and beyond. Football games, hockey games, and plays in the Collins Center for the Arts
 	  also tend to draw big crowds. Recently, for better or for worse, UMaine was recognized for having a 
 	 <A HREF=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/11/15/news/bangor/umaine-community-adds-voices-to-nationwide-anti-trump-protest//>
 	  protest</A> against President elect Donald Trump. UMaine is pretty great, and, for good or bad, 
 	  sure knows how to make the news.</p>
 	 <p>Go Black Bears!</p>
