<p>In the summers, I work at <A HREF=http://getchellbros.com//> Getchell Brothers, Inc.</A>,
an ice company located in <A HREF=http://brewermaine.gov//> Brewer</A>, Maine. 
Their Maine stations consist of a Brewer and a Sanford location. They actually just recently 
<A HREF=http://bangordailynews.com/2016/11/21/news/bangor/getchell-brothers-expanding-ice-business-across-the-river-into-bangor/> 
expanded some of their production into Bangor</A>, due to a recent explosion in summertime demand
for ice. The company has served New England since 1888. In Maine, they have a virtual 
monopoly of the ice business, and have branched into ice cream supplying as well.
