<h1>Bangor, Maine</h1>
<IMG SRC="Bangor.jpg">
<p>Hello, and welcome to <A HREF=http://www.bangormaine.gov//> Bangor</A>, Maine. I have
lived in this city of about 30,000 for my entire life. I was born here, raised here, and 
graduated from <A HREF=http://bangorhigh.bangorschools.net//> Bangor High School</A>. 
Although it was once a logging town by the Penobscot River, Bangor is now becoming more 
of a small metropolis and center of commerce.
